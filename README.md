## Project Overview 🌍
Welcome to **Hackathon Space Adventure**! This project is an engaging, interactive platform designed to generate innovative hackathon ideas, provide a roadmap for execution, and simulate the journey of turning ideas into reality. 🌟

The goal is to **gamify the hackathon experience** while offering meaningful outputs like ideas, designs, and roadmaps. Users can input hackathon details, launch a rocket 🚀, and explore planets 🌌, representing different ideas and projects.

## Features ✨

1. **Interactive Interface** 🎮:
   - A rocket launches based on user inputs, symbolizing the journey from ideation to execution.
   - The platform transitions seamlessly through multiple pages representing the stages of project development.

2. **Idea Generation** 💡:
   - Users input hackathon details, such as description, tracks, and areas of interest.
   - The platform generates unique, tailored hackathon ideas for the user.

3. **Roadmap to Success** 📋:
   - Provides a clear and concise roadmap for executing the generated idea, including research, development, and testing.

4. **Design and Code Templates** 🛠️:
   - Includes basic UI/UX designs and placeholder code for quick prototyping.

5. **Gamification** 🌌:
   - Explore planets representing various ideas.
   - Engage with the roadmap, designs, and code as part of the journey.
